							N early 100 years since the end of the Austro-Hungarian Empire,	and the last time the world heard from Carl Suchy & Söhne, Austria’s foremost name in luxury watchmaking. Given the amount of time that’s passed, and the abject scarcity of surviving examples upon which to prove such a legacy even existed, this might as well be a fresh brand
							launch.
						</p>
						<p>
							That matters little, though, as the revival of the brand is a welcome one, espe-
							cially when its debut release, the Carl Suchy & Söhne Waltz No. 1 watch man-
							ages to marry beautiful design, fne watchmaking signatures, and exclusivity
							with a surprising degree of afordability – so much so, that we had to confrm
							pricing twice just to be sure.
						</p>
						<p>
							Just like the dance from which the watch derives its inspiration, the Carl Suchy
							& Söhne Waltz No. 1 is a clinic in cohesion and classic design fuidity. Its most
							immediately apparent signature is the striking guilloché pattern on the dial,
							which is divided in half by vertical and horizontal striping, like two dancers ro-
							tating in a contra-body movement (or "CBM" in ballroom-speak), typical of
							ballroom classics like the Foxtrot, the Tango, and of course, the Waltz. The ro-
							tating small seconds indicator at 6:00 is cut out of the same CBM-inspired
							striping, and is thus aligned with the rest of the dial as it waltzes in a perfect
							circle once per minute.
						</p>
						<p>
							The rest of the dial carries similar fuidity – from the curvature of the sapphire
							crystal which matches the side profle of the 41mm (30m-water-resistant) case,
							to the sleek integrated lugs, and my favorite part: the applied minute and
							hour indices – the latter of which are set into the dial itself and curved upward
							to match the slope of the rehaut as it meets the baseband. Despite all the
							striping on the dial, the efect is subtle, but oozes pure minimalism – a theme
							which is consistently repeated throughout the watch to great efect. It should
							come as little surprise that the design language itself was inspired by the work
							of Adolf Loos, a prolifc Austrian architect from the early 20th century, re-
							nowned for mixing minimalism with modern innovations.
						</p>
						<p>
							Resurrecting the long-dormant Carl Suchy & Söhne name and bringing the
							Waltz No. 1 to life was a collaborative efort of sorts, between Marc Jenni of
							the AHCI (the Académie Horlogère des Créateurs Indépendants – a member-
							ship of the top independent watchmakers in the world), designers Reinhard
							and Milos Ristin, creative director
							Robert Punkenhofer, and then move-
							ment maker Vaucher Fleurier Manu-
							facture who was tasked with build-
							ing the watch’s COSC-certifed auto-
							matic caliber. As a go-to for custom
							movement manufacture in the
							realms of haute horology, Vaucher’s
							work usually speaks for itself, and no
							less so for the simple but attractive Vaucher VMF 5401 movement (50 hours of
							power reserve) in the Carl Suchy & Söhne Waltz No. 1. In this case, the Vaucher
							touch is (fguratively) written all over the view through the Carl Suchy & Söhne
							Waltz No. 1’s exhibition caseback where, for instance, the micro-rotor is ex-
							pertly fnished with the same perpendicular vertical and horizontal striping as
							found on the dial.

							5,900 euros, which we’d argue is a paltry sum, given the level of fnishing and
